# Ride Sharing Analysis 

## Overview 

This project was an analysis of ride-sharing dating based on different city types. The goal was to compare and visualize data from January to end of April in 2019 to see outcome and what conclusions can be made. The visualizations include a summary that gives averages and totals based on city type and a line graph that shows the fare totals for each city type.

## Results 

### Summary DataFrame

The summary DataFrame gives us a good look at the following stats per city type. 
- Total Rides 
- Total Drivers 
- Total Fares 
- Average Fare per Ride 
- Average Fare per Driver

The first thing that stands out is the huge difference in the number of rides and drivers between each city type. With 78 drivers in Rural areas and 2,405 in urban areas, which is a 187% difference, it's clear that drivers are more needed in urban areas and also more abundant. Another interesting statistic is the average fares. While the "Average Fare per Ride" aren't too far apart, the difference between "Average Fare per Driver" is quite interesting. On average, drivers in Rural areas earned $40 more than drivers in Urban areas, which have the most drivers and rides by far. From this information, it would seem that being a driver in Rural Areas is the best option. 

### Total Fare by City Type

Total Fare by City Type shows a little bit of a different story. 

When looking at this chart without any other information, it would seem that Rural and Suburban drivers have it worse when it comes to compensation. It looks this way because of the number of rides being much higher in Urban cities being so much higher. This graph is more of a visual chart to show the disparity between number of rides (which affects total fare) than it is a statistical indicator that shows the true outcomes.
