# Ride Sharing Analysis 

## Overview 

This project was an analysis of ride-sharing dating based on different city types. The goal was to compare and visualize data from January to end of April in 2019 to see outcome and what conclusions can be made. The visualizations include a summary that gives averages and totals based on city type and a line graph that shows the fare totals for each city type.

## Results 

### Summary DataFrame

The summary DataFrame gives us a good look at the following stats per city type. 
- Total Rides 
- Total Drivers 
- Total Fares 
- Average Fare per Ride 
- Average Fare per Driver

The first thing that stands out is the huge difference in the number of rides and drivers between each city type. With 78 drivers in Rural areas and 2,405 in urban areas, which is a 187% difference, it's clear that drivers are more needed in urban areas and also more abundant. Another interesting statistic is the average fares. While the "Average Fare per Ride" aren't too far apart, the difference between "Average Fare per Driver" is quite interesting. On average, drivers in Rural areas earned $40 more than drivers in Urban areas, which have the most drivers and rides by far. From this information, it would seem that being a driver in Rural Areas is the best option. 

### Total Fare by City Type

Total Fare by City Type shows a little bit of a different story. 

When looking at this chart without any other information, it would seem that Rural and Suburban drivers have it worse when it comes to compensation. It looks this way because of the number of rides being much higher in Urban cities being so much higher. This graph is more of a visual chart to show the disparity between number of rides (which affects total fare) than it is a statistical indicator that shows the true outcomes.

## Summary 

These charts both do a good job at displaying complex information in an easy-to-read format that is digestible and lets the viewer make conclusions. It also helps a company make business decisions and allows them to use the charts to further improve profit margins or customer satisfaction. 

Three business recommendations I would make to a company with these statistics would be:

- Try to increase the number of drivers in rural areas through incentives or however else possible. Drivers in these cities will make more than other cities, but also customers will end up paying less due to the average price coming down just a little bit (still enough for Rural drivers to make more). The price might be too high on average for people in rural cities, in turn leading them to use a ride sharing service less. 

- Slightly raise the fare cost in urban cities to give drivers who work for them a better living. The amount of rides will still be high and customers shouldn't mind paying a few dollars more per ride if it meant that their drivers are better off for it. 

- Market the company in rural and suburban neighborhoods more. While it is true that Urban cities will simply need more drivers and have more riders, it's still worth pushing the company a little more in other city types to expand business and get more exposure.
